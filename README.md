# International-Students-Organaization-Logo
Graphic Design Project

At the time when ISO- Internationl Students Organization- newly started on my campus, we needed a logo to be regeistered as an organization. 
I designed this logo using my college's colors- green and gold- to signify that we are a part of the school. The icon of the world shows that all the members of this club are from all over the world.
